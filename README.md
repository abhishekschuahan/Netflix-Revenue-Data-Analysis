# Netflix-Revenue-Data-Analysis

This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to provide insights into Netflix’s revenue data, offering an interactive and visually engaging way to track revenue trends, analyze patterns, and identify key growth areas. The dashboard leverages various Power BI functionalities to display data-driven insights that can support decision-making and strategy formulation.

Project Overview
The Netflix Revenue Dashboard was created to present a comprehensive view of Netflix’s revenue streams. This dashboard helps stakeholders monitor key revenue metrics, identify revenue patterns across different time periods, and gain a better understanding of revenue drivers.

Key Features and Tools Used

1. Data Sources and Preparation
Data Import: Raw data was imported from various sources into Power BI, allowing for data consolidation.
Data Transformation: Power Query Editor in Power BI was used to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring that it was ready for analysis. Steps included:
Removing duplicates and filling missing values
Transforming columns for consistency (e.g., date formatting, currency conversions if applicable)
Merging tables and creating relationships between data tables

3. Data Modeling
Relationships: Established relationships between tables, enabling cross-referencing of revenue data with other variables (e.g., geographical regions, subscription types).
Calculated Columns and Measures: Created DAX measures to calculate key metrics such as total revenue, average revenue per user (ARPU), and year-over-year growth.

5. Dashboard Design
User-Friendly Layout: The dashboard was designed with a clear layout, grouping similar information and metrics together for easy access.
Interactive Elements: Utilized slicers, filters, and drill-through capabilities to allow users to filter the data by various dimensions (e.g., region, time period).

7. Data Analysis and Key Metrics
Revenue Trends: Analysis of revenue trends over time (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annual), showing growth patterns.
Average Revenue per User (ARPU): Calculated ARPU to understand how much revenue is generated on average per user.
Geographical Analysis: Breakdown of revenue by region to highlight high-growth areas and revenue distribution across different countries.
Subscription Revenue: Differentiation between revenue generated from various subscription tiers, identifying popular subscription levels and high-revenue segments.

9. Visualization
Revenue Over Time: Line or area charts displaying revenue growth over time, showing trends and seasonal patterns.
Regional Revenue: Map visualizations to depict revenue across regions, making it easy to identify key markets and regional growth.
ARPU and Subscriber Count: Bar and column charts showing ARPU changes and subscriber growth, providing insights into revenue per user trends.
Growth Rate Analysis: Percentage cards or KPI visuals showing growth metrics such as monthly or quarterly revenue growth, offering a snapshot of performance.
